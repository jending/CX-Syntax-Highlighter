# CX-Syntax-Highlighter
Here is a work-in-progress syntax highlighter for the CX programming language! This language support extension has been made for Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/

## Features
Organizes CX keywords, variable types, operators, and native function names into syntax groupings to be consumed by VS Code. Data has been gathered from https://github.com/skycoin/cx and https://www.skycoin.net/blog/overview/cx-overview/.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:
