# CX-Syntax-Highlighter
Here is a work-in-progress syntax highlighter for the CX programming language! This language support extension has been made for Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/

## Features
Organizes CX keywords, variable types, operators, and native function names into syntax groupings to be consumed by VS Code. Data has been gathered from https://github.com/skycoin/cx and https://www.skycoin.net/blog/overview/cx-overview/.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

[[https://github.com/username/repository/blob/master/img/octocat.png|alt=octocat]]


## Requirements
Requires Visual Studio Code :)

This extension hasn't been published to the VS Code extension marketplace yet Q __ Q. You can consume it by copying the repo's master/CX folder into your %userprofile%\.vscode\extensions folder.
